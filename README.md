# Algorithm
Solve any problem in simple ways.

## Crack any interview ðŸ˜‰
For this course, you do not need to worry about any specific language. Pick any programming language and go through this course. I am using JavaScript here.

### So first of all, we all have a dream to get a job in Google, Microsoft or other FAANG companies.
All these companies hire a person who has excellent problem-solving skills. So continue with me and be a problem solver to get a jobâ€¦

## What is a algorithm?
An algorithm is a  sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.Steps to bake a cake.
Learn with visualization.You can create a defination of all the keypoints while visualizing the things in algorithm.

## 1 BIG O 
How well a problem is solved is claculated by BIG O notation.
#### What is Good Code?
1. Redable.
2. Scalable :-We will cover in BIG O notation.

```javascript
// Eg:1
const arr = ['apple'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
}
findNemo(arr);//yes i found apple
```
```javascript
//The above code is similar to

const arr = ['apple'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  for(let i=0;0<fruits.length;i++){
    if('apple' === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
}
findNemo(arr);
```

1. Function first takes a array of fruits and loop through it.
2. If statement have a condition if condition full fil it returns the message written in console.
   
the above code is simple a instruction that we gave to the computer to find a fruit.
Big o notation is used to measure the performance of the code ,how much time it took to run a program.
What happens if the array goes to larger and larger?Think about it...


#### Letâ€™s measure the performance of this function
JavaScript gave us a tool performance.now() to check the performance of a program that how much time it took to solve a block of code.

In your language, you may have a different option to do this. 

```javascript
const arr = ['apple'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  let t0=performance.now();
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
  let t1=performance.now();
  console.log("Call to find apple took " + (t1 -t0) + "millisecond");
}
findNemo(arr);
//Run1 :-Call to find apple took 0.2999999523162842millisecond
//Run 2 :-Call to find apple took 0.10000014305114746millisecond
//Run 3 :-Call to find apple took 0.09999990463256836millisecond
```

### What happen if we have a larger array of elements?

```javascript
const arr = ['apple'];
const lArray=['banana','papaya','orange','apple','banana','papaya','orange','banana','papaya','orange','banana','papaya','orange'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  let t0=performance.now();
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
  let t1=performance.now();
  console.log("Call to find apple took " + (t1 -t0) + "millisecond");
}
findNemo(arr);
//Run1 :-Call to find apple took 0.3000001907348633millisecond
//Run 2 :-Call to find apple took 0.09999990463256836millisecond
//Run 3 :-Call to find apple took 0.20000004768371582millisecond
```

There is no very large difference between the first function and second function with more array elements.Because our computer is so fast 
.The difference between one loop and 10 loop is not that big.

### Increase the size of array and check again.

```javascript
const large = new Array(100).fill('apple');
//Create a new array of size 100 and fill all index with the value 'apple'
function findNemo(fruits) {
  let t0=performance.now();
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
  let t1=performance.now();
  console.log("Call to find apple took " + (t1 -t0) + "millisecond");
}
findNemo(large);//yes i found apple * 100
```

### Output with 100 elements
1. 4.1000001430511475millisecond
2. 4.900000095367432millisecond
3. 5millisecond

### Output with 1000 elements

1. 35.700000047683716millisecond
2. 50.89999985694885millisecond
3. 52millisecond

### Output with 10000 elements

1. 419.09999990463257millisecond 
2. 387.5millisecond
3. 374.5millisecond

### Output with 100000 elements

1. 3.5 seconds

# Here we see that as our input grows out function findNemo() becomes slower and slower.

If you run the same code in your computer your time can be different frome me.
It also depends on how powerful cpu and the computer you have.
Which programming language you use and which program you try to run.


All these features handles the speed of your code.

If you all have same pc or computer but still have a difference in performance ? why..

The person who write a good code tooks less time to run a program?

So what is a good code?

#### BIG O 
BIG O notation the language we use to talking about how long an algorithm takes to run

By using Big O we find that which algorith took more and less time to run.

<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.ZRwR7EASHC93avMl-ns4aAHaEY?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" width="400px">

This is a chart of Big O notaiton to find that which code took more or less time.


### Big O and Scalability of code means that:-
when we grow biger and biger with our input how much does the algorithm or function slow down.

1. In chart the bottom line indicates the number of input elements.
2. The horizontal line indicates how many operations we have to do .
   All the above is called as algorithmic efficiency.

3. Green color in chart indicates that with the increase of input operation is not increases which is a good code.
4. And red color indicates that as out input increases Operations are rapidally increases That increases Bad code because it took max time to run.
5. Each operation takes time in a computer.

# Explore the chart of Big O notation

What is the big O for findig the apple function 

<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.cff1a34fb50717531e13ffcf9d089cb5?rik=EQdlVHDhS4JSiQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.101computing.net%2fwp%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fBig-O-Notation-Linear-Algorithm.png&ehk=4G80cpT08jOZLg5Nu0QtpqFOfTv04XK4tfCViIoYlZI%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" width="400px">

see the chart it indicates that as the number of input increases the number of operation increases.Findapple function checks the every element of the array by appling operation on every array element.
*** number of arr element = number of operation ***

thats why our chart is linear.

### Our findApple function have a BIG O notaion of 
## 1. O(n) --linear time

From where n come from?
n is used because of its a standard form.
n is a arbatory lettor we can put here any value.
1. O(10)
2. O(100)
3. O(1000)

Think it as a doctor treated his single patient in 30 minutes as the patient increases total  time to treat all the patient also increases.

# 2. O(1) --Constant Time 

#### What is the big a for the below code?
```javascript
function takeArr(boxes){
console.log(boxes[0]);
}
```
Here no matter how many times the boxes increase or haw may boxes we have ,we just have to grab the first element.

<img src="https://www.section.io/engineering-education/big-o-notation/o-1.png" width="400px">

We can see clearly in the graph that we have only one operation with so many inputs Thats why our program took constant time to deals with n number of input elements.

### What if we have a different function like the below?

What is the BIG O for this function?
How do we measure the BIG O for this function?
```javascript
const boxes=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
function takeArr(boxes){
console.log(boxes[0]); //O(1) number of operation
console.log(boxes[1]); //O(2)
}
takeArr(boxes);  //O(2)
```

Our funcion call do 2 operations every time no matter the number of inputs.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DpSLIzO.jpg" width="400px">

In the above graph the green line goes one step up when O(1) + O(1) = O(2).

#### we always write O(1) for O(4),O(10) or more which is made by the combination of singel operation or O(1) + O(1) + O(1)


For a flat line BIG O is always O(1) for any number of inputs.

### Try this 
```javascript
function funChalange(input){
  let a= 10; //O(1)
  a=50+3;   //O(1)

  for(let i=0;i<input.length;i++){  //O(n) its call depends on the length of the input
    anotherFunciton();  //O(n) runs every time
    let stranger = true;  //O(n)
    a++;  //O(n)
  }
  return a; //O(1)
}

funChalange();
```

To find the eficiency of the funciton lets calculater the value of BIG O.
#### 1+1+1+n+n+n+n=3+4n
So that BIG O notation for this funciton is O(3+4n)


### Try it also

```javscript
function anotherFunChalange(input){
  let a=5;  //O(1)
  let b=10; //O(1)
  let c=50;  //O(1)
  for(let i=0;i<input;i++){  //O(n)
    let x=i+1;  //O(n)
    let y=i+2;   //O(n)
    let z=i+3;   //O(n)
  }
  for(let j = 0;j<input;j++){  //O(n)
    let p=j*2;   //O(n)
    let q=j*2;    //O(n)
  }
  let whoAmI = "I don't know";  //O(1)
}

```

Calculate the BIG O.

BIG O(4+7n)

## Simplifying BIG O

#### Ans of 1st chalange is O(n)
#### Ans of 2nd chalange is O(n)


There are several rules that you have to follow for this.

Rule 1. Worst Case.
Rule 2. Remove Constants.
Rule 3. Different terms for inputs.
Rule 4. Drop Non Dominants.


# Rule 1 Worst Case


```javascript
const every=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

function find(arr) {
  for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    console.log("running");
    if(arr[i]==5){
      console.log('Found 5 !!!');
    }
  }
}

find(every);
```

```javascript
running
running
running
running
running
running
 Found 5 !!!
running
running
running
```

This is not a efficient code so Lets make it efficient.

```javascript
const every=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

function find(arr) {
  for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    console.log("running");
    if(arr[i]==5){
      console.log('Found 5 !!!');
break;
    }
  }
}

find(every);
```

```javascript
running
running
running
running
running
running
 Found 5 !!!
```

Here when we find our ans or occurance the loop will break;


1. Big O only cares about the worst case.
2. SO what is the worst case here.
3. The worst case in the above code is that if is at last.
4. And best case is if the 5 is at the very begining.

# Rule 2 Remove Constants
####  Q1 Orint first item,first half item and say 100 times hayy.
```javascript

function printFirstItemThenFirstHalfSayhi100TImes(items){
    console.log(items[0]); // O(1)
    var middleIndex=Math.floor(items.length/2);
    var index=0;
    while(index<middleIndex){
        console.log(items[index]); //  O(n/2)
        index++;
    }
    for(var i=0;i<100;i++){
        console.log('hi');  // O(100)
    }
}

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
printFirstItemThenFirstHalfSayhi100TImes((a));

```


What is the BIG O of this function.
Note :- We are ignoring variable assignments and small calculations for this example.
#### O(1+n/2+100)

By using the rule number 2 we drop the constants.
1. Adding 100 to the array element has no very effect on n number of array elements.(O(n/2+1)).
2. Also we remove n from here because no matter how long is our aray we have to do its half every time.(O(n+1)).
3. We also remove 1 from it beacuse it also has no effect on our n number of array elements.
4. Finally (O(n)) is the value of BIG O.
5. If (O(n+5000000000)) it does not matter how long or small is our constant we just have to remove it.

### If we have another situation having 2 for loops doing same thing in the function.
What is the BIG O for this.

```javascript
function compressBoxesTwice(boxes){
  boxes.forEach(function(boxes){
    console.log(boxes);
  })

  boxes.forEach(function(boxes){
    console.log(boxes);
  })
}

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
compressBoxesTwice(a);
```
### O(2n) we jsut add both?NO
We drop the constant here 
### O(n)
<img src="https://us-static.z-dn.net/files/d7d/e7976bdb7b655d9b3727614fb46556b8.png" width="400px"/>

in the above graph we have two steps with same array Whose BIG O is (O(2n)).
But We remove constant from here because It is still a linear graph.
Because as the number of array element s increases number of operation is always two.So it has no effect on number of operatins because all operations is coverd in the same time frame so we remove the 2 which is constant here.
Here we dont care that how is the line of graph we care only for how the line moves in this case it moves linearly so the BIG O is (n).

# Rule 2 Different terms for inputs.
What if we have two inputs.

```javascript
function compressBoxesTwice(boxes,boxes2){
  boxes.forEach(function(boxes){
    console.log(boxes);
  })

  boxes2.forEach(function(boxes){
    console.log(boxes);
  })
}

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
b=[8,9,10,11,12,13];
compressBoxesTwice(a,b);
```

Here we have two inputs one is may be 100 and second is 1000000.

### n is the arbitorry letter.

The BIG O of this function is 
### O(n+m)

## O(n*n) or O(nÂ²)

Q1 Log all the pairs of the array.(important)

```javascript
function logALlPairsOfArr(array){
  for(let i=0;i<array.length;i++){
     for(let j=0;j<array.length;j++){
    console.log(array[i],array[j]);
  }
  }
}

logALlPairsOfArr([1,2,3,4,5]);
```

What is the BIG O of this.

### O(n*n)  or O(nÂ²)
O(nÂ²) = Quadratic Time

<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.FkQzWqqIMlAHZ_xNrEPKeAHaGZ?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" width="400px" />

Wen we increate the number of elements it increases quadratically.

It means in first step we have 4 operations and in second step we have 8 operations.
We have the 3Â² elements so as we increase the number of elements our operations will increase rappidly and make a curve in graph.


# Rule no 4 = Drop Non Dominants.

```javascript
 function printAllNumbersThenAllPairSums(numbers) {
        console.log("These are the numbers");
        numbers.forEach((number) => {
          console.log(number);//O(n)
        });

        console.log("And these are their sums ");
        numbers.forEach((firstNumber) => {
          numbers.forEach((secondNumber) => {
            console.log(firstNumber + secondNumber);//O(OÂ²)
          });
        });
      }

      printAllNumbersThenAllPairSums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```
```Javascript
//Output
These are the numbers
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
And these are their sums 
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 3
 4
 5

 7
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 5

10
```

### What is the BIG O for the above code?

O(n + nÂ²)

#### Use here 4th rule (Drop Non Dominents)
That means we only care about the most important term or the term wich dominant.This is because as the number of element is increases the n is less importance because the nÂ² is bigger than that SO that we always keep the dominent term.

##### O(xÂ²+3x+100+x/2)
By removing the non Dominating term we get the BIG O = O(xÂ²)
1. 500*2=5500
2. 500/2=250
3. 500*3=1500

Thats why we let the xÂ² as the Dominating term.

NOTE := The nÂ² is very bad.(nested looping)

# Summary What does all these mean

### Datastructure + Algorithms = Programs

Datastructure are simply store data and algorithm is the functions that always use ds to write our programs.

#### whats the write datastructure and whats the write algorithm to write the program.

# O(n!) ohno! dont use this

# What is a Good code?

1. Redable
2. Scalable.

Scalable 
1. -speed:-How fast your code run.How many time it took to run.How many operation does it perform.
2. Memory:- Computers have limited memory.(RAM)

   1. Redable and clean code (maintanable)
   2. Speed (Time Complexity)
   3. Memory (Space Complexity)

# Space Complexity
When programs executes there are two ways to remember things Heap and Stack.
#### Heap - store variables and where we assign values.

#### Stack - Where we keep track of our function calls.

## What Causes space Complexity.

1. Variable
2. Data structure
3. functions
4. Allocation

### Exercise Space complexity

```javascript
function foooo(n){
    for(let i=0;i<n.length;i++){
        console.log("boooooo!")
    }
}

foooo([1,2,3,4,5])
```

```javascript
boooooo!
boooooo!
boooooo!
boooooo!
boooooo!

```

##### What is the time complexity of this function?
When we are tawlking about space complexity we are tawlking about additional space.
We really dont care how big the input is.
We really dont have controll over the input we only have a controll on what happens inside the funciton.

#### ans BIG O(1) space complexity
because we are not adding any more memory in the above funciotn.

### What if we have ?

```javascript
function arrayOfHiNTimes(n){
    let hiArray=[];
    for(let i=0;i<n;i++){
       hiArray[i]="hi";
    }
    return hiArray;
};

console.log(arrayOfHiNTimes(6)) //O(n)
```

```javascript
[ 'hi', 'hi', 'hi', 'hi', 'hi', 'hi' ]
```

### What is the space Complexity of this function?
1. Variable
2. Data structure
3. functions
4. Allocation

these things take care of space complexity.
In our case we created variable,Datastructure(new array).

### O(n) because we fill the hi as the number of input.


# Exercise Twitter

```javascript
//Find the most recent tweet and oldest tweet
const array = ["hi","my","teddy"];
array[0];  //O(1)
array[array.length-1] //O(1)
```

### What is the big O for the below O(n pow 2) because we have to compare it with all its values.

```javascript
//Also with date
const array = [
    {
        tweet:'hi',
        date:2020
    },
    {
        tweet:'hello',
        date:2010
    },
    {
        tweet:'good',
        date:2000
    },
    ]
```

###### what is the big O of arr.length

What is the big O notation of this .length 

## Ans its not a funciton that have to run its simple a builtin property of object its big o is (O(1)) constant time.


# There is a so many ways to loop in javascript 
1. forEach:

```javascript
let arr=[1,2,3,4,5]

const find3=array=>{
    array.forEach(number=>{
        if(number==3){
            console.log("found 3")
        }
    })
}

find3(arr);

//Found 3
```

2. For in loop
```javascript
let arr=[1,2,3,4,5]

const find3=array=>{
   for(let fish of array){
        if(fish==3){
            console.log("found 3")
        }
    }
}

find3(arr);

//Found 3
```
These are the Three ways to write the same code.

# Summary of BIG O

1. Some time by thinking about scalability we forgot the readability of the code.
2. Linear time algorithm is better than the constant time algorithm.
3. At last you know How to alalyse the code of others and you are able to find the difference between good and bad code.

# Chapter 2
# How to solve coding problems.

An interwiew is the way to find that are you able to solve the problem or not.

Just like a real life of coding you not neet to remember the things you have to deeply analyze the code.

<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw' >What this google interview </a>

# Q1 
Given 2 Arrays ,create a function that let's a user know (true/false) whether these two arrays contain any common items 

```javascript
\\for example
\\const array[1,2,3,4,5];
\\const array2[13,23,33,43,5];
\\should return true


\\const array[1,2,3,4,5];
\\const array2[13,23,33,43,53];
\\should return false

```

```javascript
function checkCommon(arr1,arr2){
    for(let i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
        for(let j=0;j<arr2.length;j++){
        if(arr1[i]==arr2[j]){

    }
      
    }
  return false;
}


console.log(checkCommon([11,27,3],[1,2,3]))
\\true
\\BIG O(n pow 2) or O(n*n)
\\this is bad code according to BIG O notation
```

### Note before code in interview

#### Step By Step through a problem
1. When the interviewer says the question, write down the key points at the top (i.e. sorted
array). Make sure you have all the details. Show how organized you are.(2 parameters.return true or false)

2. Make sure you double check: What are the inputs? What are the outputs?
3. What is the most important value of the problem? Do you have time, and space and memory,
etc.. What is the main goal?(ask question array of length is fix or n)

4.  Don't be annoying and ask too many questions.(first create the image of the question without dought because you have no time to make mistakes in interview)
5.  Start with the naive/brute force approach. First thing that comes into mind. It shows that
youâ€™re able to think well and critically (you don't need to write this code, just speak about it)(in our question we have to create two for loops to compare single array value to whole array element of the second array)

6. Tell them why this approach is not the best (i.e. O(n^2) or higher, not readable, etc...(there are two nested loops which is a bad thing because of BIG O)
7. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things.
Any repetition, bottlenecks like O(N^2), or unnecessary work? Did you use all the information
the interviewer gave you? Bottleneck is the part of the code with the biggest Big O. Focus on
that. Sometimes this occurs with repeated work as well

8. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to
follow

```javascript
//Most usable pattern
array1==>obj{
a:true,
b:true,
c:true,
d:true}
array2[index]===obj.properties;
```
```javascript
//Write down the steps


function containCommonItem2(arr1,arr2){
//loop through first array and create object were properties === items in the array
//loop through second array and check if item in second array exists on created objects.
}
```
##### BIG O(a+b) this is good code you make the code better

##### Solve first step
```javascript
//Write down the steps


function containCommonItem2(arr1,arr2){
//loop through first array and create object were properties === items in the array
let map={};
for(let i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
    //if(!map[i])  or

    if(!map[arr1[i]]){
        const item=arr1[i];
        map[item]=true;
    }
}
console.log(map);
//loop through second array and check if item in second array exists on created objects.
}

containCommonItem2(['a','b','c'],['d','e']);

\\{ a: true, b: true, c: true }
```
##### Solve second step

```javascript
function containCommonItem2(arr1,arr2){
//loop through first array and create object were properties === items in the array
let map={};
for(let i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
    if(!map[i]){
        const item=arr1[i];
        map[item]=true; //map[a]=true ---{a:tree}
    }
}
console.log(map);
//loop through second array and check if item in second array exists on created objects.

for(let j=0;j<arr2.length;j++){
    if(map[arr2[j]]){
        return true;
    }
}
return false;
}

containCommonItem2(['a','b','c'],['d','e']);
console.log(containCommonItem2(['a','b','c'],['d','e']))
console.log(containCommonItem2(['a','b','c'],['d','c']))

\\ BIG O(a+b) because of two steps are there only which is better then nesting
```

##### note
1. ! this turns the true into false and false into true
2. O(a+b) time complexity is achieved


9.Modularize your code from the very beginning. Break up your code into beautiful small pieces
and add just comments if you need to

10.Start actually writing your code now. Keep in mind that the more you prepare and understand
what you need to code, the better the whiteboard will go. So never start a whiteboard
interview not being sure of how things are going to work out. That is a recipe for disaster.
Keep in mind: A lot of interviews ask questions that you wonâ€™t be able to fully answer on time.
So think: What can I show in order to show that I can do this and I am better than other
coders. Break things up in Functions (if you canâ€™t remember a method, just make up a function
and you will at least have it there. Write something, and start with the easy part.

11. Think about error checks and how you can break this code. Never make assumptions about the
input. Assume people are trying to break your code and that Darth Vader is using your
function. How will you safeguard it? Always check for false inputs that you donâ€™t want. Here is
a trick: Comment in the code, the checks that you want to doâ€¦ write the function, then tell the
interviewer that you would write tests now to make your function fail (but you won't need to
actually write the tests).

##### Lets try to break code remove unwanted things and try it with different type of inputs

1. ['a',1,'c'];
2. Object properties are turned into strings when created
3.  ['a',[],'c']; \\true
4.  ['a',null,'c']; \\true

#### what happens when the function is called with just one array we get an error make it error free. try possible vlause to use and make it eoor free.

1. if i pass 2nd parameter 0. (arr1,0)//false
2.  (arr1,null) //error
3.  Write better name for your variable.

### Make this code more redable by using the methods of that specific programming language here we use (SOME)


```javascript
function containCommonItem2(arr1,arr2){
return arr1.some(item => arr2.includes(item))
}

console.log(containCommonItem2(['a','b','c'],['d','e']))
console.log(containCommonItem2(['a','b','c'],['d','c']))
```




12. Donâ€™t use bad/confusing names like i and j. Write code that reads well
13. Test your code: Check for no params, 0, undefined, null, massive arrays, async code, etcâ€¦ Ask
the interviewer if we can make assumption about the code. Can you make the answer return
an error? Poke holes into your solution. Are you repeating yourself?

15. Finally talk to the interviewer where you would improve the code. Does it work? Are there
different approaches? Is it readable? What would you google to improve? How can
performance be improved? Possibly: Ask the interviewer what was the most interesting
solution you have seen to this probles

 16.If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here. It is also
common that the interviewer asks you extension questions, such as how you would handle the
problem if the whole input is too large to fit into memory, or if the input arrives as a stream.
This is a common follow-up question at Google, where they care a lot about scale. The answer
is usually a divide-and-conquer approachâ€Šâ€”â€Šperform distributed processing of the data and only
read certain chunks of the input from disk into memory, write the output back to disk and
combine them later

#### Also deal with space complexity O(a*b) = O(1) because no new variable is created in first code.


#### write a modular code means make your code in peaces that every peace has a single or limited work to do.

# Google question is left

# Chapter 4  (intro Data structure)

A DataStructure is a collection of values. amd Algorithms are steps or processes we put into place to manipulate these collection of values.

These two things allow us to write programs.

##### DataStructure + Algorithm = Program

A Person who knows How DSA works can write a great code.Libraries can be change but fundamentalsa and algorithm concepts are always same thats why big tech companies ask questions in DSA.

## What is a Data Structue?
A Data Structure is a collection of values.The values can have relationship among them and they can have different funcitonality.

##### eg
A data structure is simply a file cabinate of different type like:-bag,drower,toy box,friz,folder etc.
1. Each container has its own storing characteristic like i am not goint to put cake in almira ,and files into frizz,
2. Each container is specified for its own thing,
3. Data Structure is simple to organize our data so that we can easily retrive our data and grab that item very fast.
4. There are so many data structure.
5. Like we collect fruits and delever it to a grocerry store and organizing them in grocerry stores so that humans can grab those and buy it so its a real life scenerio.
6. Each Data Structure has its own specific case of advantage.

   ### 2 parts to understand Data Structure

   1. How to build one?
   2. How to use it (80% importance)
   Because Data structure are some time prebuilt so we have only to focus about How to use it;

Pick write Data Structure for your problem.
For any senerio data needs to be stored in specific containers.


## How computers work?
1. What is a Memory and what is the difference between Ram and HDD?
Ans:-
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBv_FY3cqwU/maxresdefault.jpg" width="500px" >
Memory is just storage.Ram and HDD both store data but the difference beteen them is that storing and retriving data in Ram is lot faster than HDD.But HDD storage is persistance meaning is that if you turn off the computer data will still be there but the data stored in ram is volatile means if you turn off the computer every thing in Ram will  gone.Ram is a Temporary space to work in.
In Order to keep track of a code computer needs to keep track of variables like Numbers,Strings and arrays.
If you run a program the variable in the code will store in ram Is Quickly retrived by the cpu But if you off the computer the variables in the computer ram will gone.
So why we not use the Storage to not to loose our data? because its slow .Our computer runs bu CPU (to do alll the calculations) It does the actual work in the computer.And CPU can access the values from the RAM alot faster.
When we are soing any task on CPU it is stored in RAM and when we close the computer all the data goes.SO we need to make it permanent.

##### Why Ram is faster then Rom??? 
##### What is a 32 bit computer?

<img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lpqgSfYz2F4/U0aCl8H7S1I/AAAAAAAABro/4gjyL8n68-s/s1600/Cache+memory.jpg" width="500px" >

### How Ram cpu and rom works?
<img src="controll.png" width="100%" >
8 Numbers in every shell and earch number is a Bit and a Bit is a tiny electrical switch that can be turned on or off that represents 0 and 1.
Each shelf has one byte of storage and cpu is connected to memory controller and memory controller does the actual reading of all these self.
The connection of cpu to memory controller is important because CPU asks to the memory hey what is in shelf 1.
Memoery controller is connected to all the shelfs .it can access  272 indexes without retriving because its individually connected to all the shelfs.
Thats why its name is Ramdom Access Memory.
The smallesr the indexes 1--1000 its easy to read and write for CPU.
Thats why we reboot to make our device fast.

##### what is CPU cash?
The cpu has a Tiny memory to store recent copy of data.

##### What is Byte?
Think my Computer has 32 GB of memory 

<img src="https://www.schoolcoders.com/img/data-representation/binary/byte.png" width="500px">

#### 32GB = 32*1000000000 Bytes
Each Bytes contain 8 Bits of storage And one bit is a state.It can be 0 and 1..

The combination of 8 bits of data represent so many values 8 Bit can reprenet 256 states of data.
How can we represent Characters??We map the numbers from(256) to characters So we can call that Number 97 is a and 98 is b.Thats why we have ASCII character code where numbers are maped with characters 


##### How to access the data from the memory?
The small accessible unit of memory is Byte Our CPU can access a package of 8 bits and it can not access single Bit .Every Shelf has a address and to access the data from memory we need that address.
Example if we have a 1MB of memory The address of first Byte is 0 and last byte is 1048575 
##### 1Kilobyte = 1024 Bytes
##### 1Megabyte = 1024 Kilobytes
##### 1Megabyte =1024*1024 Bytes = 1048576 Bytes

Usually The memory address is represented by Hexadecimal codes So the address of first element of MB is (0x00000) and last is (0xFFFFF)

##### Does a Integer or string require One Byte only?
Some data types require more memory then others Like Integer require 4Bytes to store a integer and a Character on a string  only take 1Byte.


#### Why its important for Data Structure?
Data Structure take care of data storage and ways to store data so that we can access it quickly.
Example:
```javascript
var a=1;
//1 takes 4Bytes and is represented by 32Bits.

Math.pow(5,1000)
//Infinity
//As the number becomes too longer to store inour Ram JavaScript makes it Infinity.

```

Our Goal is to minimize the Operation that we need to do For CPU to get information and to write information.Thats why Data Structure is so Powerfull.

##### Data Structure in Different Langusges.
All  the Languages has datatypes like in js we have
1. Number = 1
2. Boolean = True
3. Undefine
4. String='A'
ALl Languages has Data Structures to Organize there Data Types Eg in js we have Array and Object.

```javascript
[] //Array
{} //Objects 
```
It allows us to Organize our Primitive DataTypes and Complex like.Array of Objects.

```javascript
let arrOfObj=[{},{},{}];
```
Some Languages has PreBuilt DataStructures Or We can Built These Datastructures.

Every DS has its own use some are good at one Operation or Other are good at different Operation.

#### Uses of DS?
1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Traversal (access Every Data at once)
4. Searching
5. Sorting
6. Access


# 1. Array (First Data Structure)
1. It organizes the data sequentially.
2. It is most asked because it has a least amount of rules.
3. It store data in contiguous memory location.
4. If you want to go all the elements one by one arrays are the best choice.


<img src="array1.png" width="500px" />

  ```javascript
const strings=['a','b','c','d'];

//Computer store strings for me

//One element take 32Bits and 4 selfs(having 8bits in one self)
// 4 elements * 4 selfs = 16 bytes
// Each item like a take 4selfs
// Finally we are clear that to store 4 array elements we need 16Bytes of storage.

```
  
****************************

```javascript
string[2] //'c'
//It grabs elements from memory for me
//here we tell the computer to grab the item which is stored in the array of memory address (2).
```

##### Push() (adding element at last)

```javascript
string.push('e') //O(1)
//Becasue it only adds the new element at last without disturbing any other array element
```

##### Pop() (remove element from last)

```javascript
string.pop(); //O(1)
//Same as push() it also do a single task for any type of array.
```


##### unShift() (add element at first)

```javascript
string.unshift('x') //O(n)
```
Its BIG O is n because when we try to add element at first while using unshift .We first have to move  the array element by one index at right so that we get the space for our first element.Becasue of doing work for every element in the array the BIG O is O(n).May be array is not good to add the element at very beginning of the array.

##### splice(start,delete,"new element") (add element to center)

```javascript
string.splice(2,0,"alien");//O(n/2)  or O(n)
```

When we try to add an element at center we have to move half of the array element to right Thats why the BIG O to add element at center of the array is O(n/2).


## Static vs Dynamic array

Static means fix in size.like create an array of 7 elements,It books only seven memory to avoid the addition of extra elements.
Ans dynamic array allows its size to increase and decrease.

```cpp
//in c++ arrays are static
int a[20];
int b[5]{1,2,3,4,5};
//Array having space of 5 elements
```

##### you are thinking that dynamic arrays are good because we not need to worry about size of the array.(But its bad for managing memory)

when we add any element at last of the array our computer or system moves full array to different memory location with the new element added at last so for constant time its BIG O is O(1) and for linear time its BIG O is O(n).

###### Static Array

A static array is an array that has a fixed size and is allocated at compile time. It stores elements in contiguous memory locations, so they can be accessed very efficiently using indices. For example, if we declare a static array of 10 integers in Java, it will look something like this in memory:

0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9

Each cell represents a memory location that can store an integer value. The array has a fixed size of 10, so it cannot grow or shrink at run time. The array also has a name, which is a reference to the first element of the array. For example, if we name the array foo, then foo will point to the memory location of the element at index 0. We can access any element of the array by using the name and the index, such as foo[0], foo[1], etc.

The advantage of static arrays is that they are fast and simple to use. The disadvantage is that they are inflexible and may waste memory if the size is not known in advance or if the array is not fully utilized. 


###### Dynamic array

A dynamic array is an array that has a variable size and is allocated at run time. It stores elements in contiguous memory locations, but it can grow or shrink as needed by allocating a new memory block and copying the elements from the old block to the new one. For example, if we declare a dynamic array of 10 integers in C, it will look something like this in memory:

0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
Each cell represents a memory location that can store an integer value. The array has an initial size of 10, but it can change at run time. The array also has a name, which is a pointer to the first element of the array. For example, if we name the array ptr, then ptr will point to the memory location of the element at index 0. We can access any element of the array by using the name and the index, such as ptr[0], ptr[1], etc.

The advantage of dynamic arrays is that they are flexible and can accommodate any number of elements. The disadvantage is that they are slower and more complex to use. They also require extra memory for storing the size and capacity of the array, and they may cause memory fragmentation when reallocating memory blocks. 


## Optional Classes in js

1. Referencce Type
2. Context
3. Instatiation


#### 1.Reference Type
```javascript
//Object is a reference type and array is also an object in javascript

//1.
[]===[];//false
[1]===[1];//false

//2.
var object1={value:10};
var object2=object1;
var object3={value:10};

object1===object2;//true
object1===object3;//true (Both have different box or container)


```
1. true,"hello",null,undefined all are defined by programming language.
2. These types are called as primitive type.
3. And [],{} are reference type or non-primitive type.
4. Non-primitive types are not created by the programming languages.They are created by programmers.

   ```javascript
   var object1={value:1}; //a new box or container is created 
   var object2=object1;   //we only give the reference of the same box object1 and not created a new box thats why it returns true while we compare it.
   
   var object3={value:1};//a new box object3 is also created which is a different box and we dont know what is in this thats why if we compare two objet with same values and properties it return false because we compare different boxes.
   ```
```javascript
[]===[];//arrays are also object (false)
```


### 1.Context (context vs scope)

a new function creates a new scope 

```javascript
function(){
//outer scope does not know what is inside this function
//the scope of the variables inside this function is private.
}
```
And context tells us about where we are in the object.

```javascript
console.log(this);//window
//means we are currently in window object

//check
console.log(this===window);//true

this.alert("hwllo");//window object is changed by this
```

"this" means is what is the object environment that we are in right now.
And this represent what is left to the dot 

```javascript
window.alert()
this.alert()
//both are same 
```

Why "this" is important.

```javascript
function a(){
console.log(this);
}
a();//window
window.a();//window
//note window is attached automatically
```
```javascript
const object4={
a:function(){
console.log(this);
}}
object.a();//object4{}
//because we are currently in object4
```
