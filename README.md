# Algorithm
Solve any problem in simple ways.

## Crack any interview ðŸ˜‰
For this course, you do not need to worry about any specific language. Pick any programming language and go through this course. I am using JavaScript here.

### So first of all, we all have a dream to get a job in Google, Microsoft or other FAANG companies.
All these companies hire a person who has excellent problem-solving skills. So continue with me and be a problem solver to get a jobâ€¦

## What is a algorithm?
An algorithm is a fintie number of step to solve a problem.Steps to bake a cake.
Learn with visualization.You can create a defination of all the keypoints while visualizing the things in algorithm.

## 1 BIG O 
How well a problem is solved is claculated by BIG O notation.
#### What is Good Code?
1. Redable.
2. Scalable :-We will cover in BIG O notation.

```javascript
// Eg:1
const arr = ['apple'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
}
findNemo(arr);//yes i found apple
```
```javascript
//The above code is similar to

const arr = ['apple'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  for(let i=0;0<fruits.length;i++){
    if('apple' === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
}
findNemo(arr);
```

1. Function first takes a array of fruits and loop through it.
2. If statement have a condition if condition full fil it returns the message written in console.
   
the above code is simple a instruction that we gave to the computer to find a fruit.
Big o notation is used to measure the performance of the code ,how much time it took to run a program.
What happens if the array goes to larger and larger?Think about it...


#### Letâ€™s measure the performance of this function
JavaScript gave us a tool performance.now() to check the performance of a program that how much time it took to solve a block of code.

In your language, you may have a different option to do this. 

```javascript
const arr = ['apple'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  let t0=performance.now();
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
  let t1=performance.now();
  console.log("Call to find apple took " + (t1 -t0) + "millisecond");
}
findNemo(arr);
//Run1 :-Call to find apple took 0.2999999523162842millisecond
//Run 2 :-Call to find apple took 0.10000014305114746millisecond
//Run 3 :-Call to find apple took 0.09999990463256836millisecond
```

### What happen if we have a larger array of elements?

```javascript
const arr = ['apple'];
const lArray=['banana','papaya','orange','apple','banana','papaya','orange','banana','papaya','orange','banana','papaya','orange'];
function findNemo(fruits) {
  let t0=performance.now();
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
  let t1=performance.now();
  console.log("Call to find apple took " + (t1 -t0) + "millisecond");
}
findNemo(arr);
//Run1 :-Call to find apple took 0.3000001907348633millisecond
//Run 2 :-Call to find apple took 0.09999990463256836millisecond
//Run 3 :-Call to find apple took 0.20000004768371582millisecond
```

There is no very large difference between the first function and second function with more array elements.Because our computer is so fast 
.The difference between one loop and 10 loop is not that big.

### Increase the size of array and check again.

```javascript
const large = new Array(100).fill('apple');
//Create a new array of size 100 and fill all index with the value 'apple'
function findNemo(fruits) {
  let t0=performance.now();
  for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    if(fruits[i] === 'apple'){
      console.log("yes i found apple");
    }
  }
  let t1=performance.now();
  console.log("Call to find apple took " + (t1 -t0) + "millisecond");
}
findNemo(large);//yes i found apple * 100
```

### Output with 100 elements
1. 4.1000001430511475millisecond
2. 4.900000095367432millisecond
3. 5millisecond

### Output with 1000 elements

1. 35.700000047683716millisecond
2. 50.89999985694885millisecond
3. 52millisecond

### Output with 10000 elements

1. 419.09999990463257millisecond
2. 387.5millisecond
3. 374.5millisecond

### Output with 100000 elements

1. 3097.2999999523163millisecond
